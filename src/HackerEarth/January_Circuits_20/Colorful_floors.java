Colorful floors
Max. Marks: 100

    The floor of your house consists of five rows of square tiles and each row is N tiles long.
    You must paint the whole floor by using at most four colors such that the total number of ith (1 <= i <= 4)
    colored tiles in any two consecutive columns of the floor should not exceed K. Determine the number of
    ways in which you can paint the floor.
    Since the answer can be very large, compute it modulo 10^9 + 7

    Note: The floor should be completely painted. If there is no way to paint the floor completely, then print 0.

    Input format
        First line: Two space-separated integers N and K

    Output format
       Print a single integer that denotes the number of ways to paint the floor completely.

    Constraints
        1 <= N <= 1000
        1 <= K <= 10

    SAMPLE INPUT
        2 3

    SAMPLE OUTPUT
        218400
